# Touch Template

touch, with a template

Available on cargo, with `cargo install touchtemplate` ([Link to crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/touchtemplate)).
Then you can use the `tt` command.

This provides the `tt` binary, which looks in `~/Templates` (or whatever
you have `$XDG_TEMPLATE_DIR` set to), and will allow you to touch
(create) files, by copying them and renaming them to whatever you wish.

This utility is inspired by KDE's usage of the templates directory when using
the right click menu to "Create New" in a directory.

## Usage
